## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

1. **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.  
2. **Silver Layer:** Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.  
3. **Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### **Objective**

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

#### **Specifications**

- Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files  
- Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis  
- Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries  
- Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required  
- Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
