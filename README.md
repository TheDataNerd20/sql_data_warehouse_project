## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

1. **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.  
2. **Silver Layer:** Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.  
3. **Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
